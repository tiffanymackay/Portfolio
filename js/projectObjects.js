I created napkin sketches using my digital tablet, a Figma mockup of a high fidelity wireframe, then coded using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. I made it live by uploading to GitHub. For the responsiveness, I created different break points to implement media queries. The code is semantic and I use comments for improved organization. Flexbox and grid were both used for different sections of the page.`,
